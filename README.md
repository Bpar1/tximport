* deal with length `NaN` from abundances of 0:
  take average of length of other samples, more data driven than
  taking simple average over isoforms
* count matrix from scaled TPM
* simply return transcript-level counts, abundances, lengths
* preset 'types' for different software
* how to pass off to DESeq2, edgeR, limma+voom?
