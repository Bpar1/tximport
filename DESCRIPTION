Title: Import and summarize transcript-level estimates for gene-level analysis
Description: Imports transcript-level abundance, estimated counts and
    transcript lengths, and summarizes into matrices for use with downstream
    gene-level analysis packages. Average transcript length, weighted by
    sample-specific transcript abundance estimates, is provided as a matrix
    which can be used as an offset for different expression of
    gene-level counts.
