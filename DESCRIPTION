Title: Import and summarize transcript-level estimates for gene-level analysis
Description: Imports transcript-level abundance, estimated counts and 
 transcript lengths, and summarizes into matrices for use with downstream
 gene-level analysis packages. Average transcript length, weighted by 
 sample-specific transcript abundance estimates, is provided as a matrix
 which can be used as an offset for different expression of 
 gene-level counts.
